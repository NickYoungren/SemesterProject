    "description": "The McGangBang, also called the Bababooey Burger is a very popular, if not the most popular, Secret Menu item McDonald's has to offer. The absurd and grotesque title gives a look into the nature of the burger. The McGangbang originally started by putting a McChicken (Or Junior Chicken in Canada) in between a Double Cheeseburger or McDouble. It was a way to get more \"bang\" for your buck when ordering from the Value Menu. The modern variation of the McGangBang is made out of a McSausage (or McShmeaty), but instead of placing it between a McDouble or Double Cheese, it's placed between a Big Mac and the Big Mac's middle bun is removed to create the McGangBang.",
